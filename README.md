# Cancellation Policy
Cancellation Policy

Please Read: 
Because business is growing and spots are filling more quickly, we want to make sure the schedule is accurate when you want to book.

When a client cancels or fails to show up we can't offer this time to someone else, which is unfair to other clients. To fix this, cancellation within 24 hours of the appointment start time will be subject to a 50% fee and no-shows will have a 100% fee.  Also, $25 non-refundable deposit is required when booking through email, facebook inbox, text, or phone.  Deposits can be paid through PayPal or in person.

Thanks for your understanding and continued support! We look forward to seeing you soon.
